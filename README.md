# 🚌 Vibe Bus Simulator (Three.js + Rapier)

A **browser-based**, **100% vibe-coded** city bus simulator built with:
- **Three.js** (rendering)
- **Rapier** (physics)

No backend. No engine. Just JavaScript + vibes.

## Run

```
cd /path/to/your/project
python3 -m http.server 8000

```

Open `index.html` in a modern browser.

> If your assets (like `.glb`) don’t load when opened via `file://`, serve the folder as a static site (any simple static server works).

## Assets

- `assets/public/` contains shareable assets (tracked in git).
- Everything else under `assets/` is treated as licensed/private and is not shared in the repository.
