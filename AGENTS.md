# Agent Notes

- Follow `PROJECT_RULES.md` (and `PROJECT_RULES.local.md`) for repo structure, coding style, comments, commits, and asset rules.
- When creating AI prompt files, follow `AI_PROMPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for naming and structure.
  - User requested `create promtpt` or `create ai` or `create ai prompt`. Or similar variations.

## Debug suggestion
- If a problem doesn't resolve after multiple prompts, it might be another issue
  - Add a test to validate some assumptions 
    - Did the resources loaded?
    - Quick unit test the APIs
    - Other kinds of tests you find suitable to verify
