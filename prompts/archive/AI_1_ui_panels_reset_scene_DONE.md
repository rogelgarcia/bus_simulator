#Problem [DONE]

The UI needs new view option placement and reset flow updates for building
fabrication settings.

# Request

Update the editor UI layout and reset behavior for building fabrication
controls.

Tasks:
- Put wireframe, floor divisions, and floorplan view toggles in their own
  panel.
- Move the Reset Scene button into another panel together with the wire view
  options.
- Remove the grid size control from the building fabrication section.
- When Reset Scene is clicked, show a popup that asks for the grid size.

## On completion
- When complete mark the AI document as DONE by adding a marker in the first
  line
- Also rename the AI file to AI_#_title_DONE
- Provide a summary of the changes made in the AI document (very high level,
  one liner)

Summary: Added a dedicated View panel for wire/floor toggles, moved Reset Scene there, removed inline grid controls, and prompt for grid size on reset.
