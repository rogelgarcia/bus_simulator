# DONE

#Problem

In the material calibration room we need a direct way to compare raw textures against calibrated outputs generated by the correction pipeline.

Without an explicit raw/calibrated switch, it is hard to validate whether corrections are actually improving the result. Also, combo/select controls need slightly better vertical breathing room.

# Request

Add a raw-vs-calibrated toggle to the calibration room options panel and improve combo/select vertical spacing.

Tasks:
- Add an options-panel toggle that switches between:
  - Raw (original texture behavior)
  - Calibrated (apply generated correction config)
- Ensure toggle behavior is immediate and consistent across all calibration platforms/material previews.
- Ensure the toggle does not break existing selection/slot assignment logic, camera tools, screenshot flow, or persistence expectations.
- Make sure UI labels clearly communicate which mode is active.
- Add a small vertical padding increase to combo/select controls in the calibration room options area so controls have better spacing without changing panel width behavior.
- Keep panel layout stable and avoid introducing horizontal scroll.

## On completion
- When complete mark the AI document as DONE by adding a marker in the first line
- Rename the file in `prompts/` to `prompts/AI_DONE_345_UI_calibration_room_raw_vs_calibrated_toggle_and_combo_spacing_DONE.md`
- Do not move to `prompts/archive/` automatically.
- Provide a summary of the changes made in the AI document (very high level, one liner for each change)

## Summary of changes
- Added a `Texture mode` toggle in the calibration options panel with `Calibrated (pipeline)` and `Raw (original)` states, including active-mode status text.
- Implemented runtime loading of per-material correction configs (`pbr.material.correction.config.js`) and ACES preset mapping to calibration overrides.
- Wired raw/calibrated mode into scene synchronization so all slots, previews, and screenshots use the selected mode immediately and consistently.
- Added roughness interval remap shader support in `MaterialCalibrationScene` so pipeline roughness min/max/gamma corrections are applied during calibrated rendering.
- Increased vertical spacing/padding for calibration select/number controls without changing panel width behavior or introducing horizontal scroll.
