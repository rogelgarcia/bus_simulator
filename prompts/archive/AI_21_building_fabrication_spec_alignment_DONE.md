#Problem [DONE]

Current building fabrication implementation and UI do not fully match the
requirements in `BUILDING_FABRICATION_SPEC` (layer-based definition, roof ring
spec, belted floors, window catalog + spacing rules, space columns, unified
material picker, and mandated module organization).

# Request

Adjust building fabrication implementation and UI to conform to
`BUILDING_FABRICATION_SPEC`.


## On completion

  one liner)

Summary: Added a layer-based building fabrication pipeline (floor/roof layers, belts, roof rings, window catalog + spacers) and updated the fabrication UI to edit layers.
