#Problem [DONE]

There is no concept of procedural meshes or a way to inspect them in a
standalone scene with interactive controls and stable identifiers that can be
used to guide AI-driven edits.

# Request

Introduce procedural mesh definitions and add a mesh inspector scene with a
catalog UI to browse, inspect, and reference mesh parts by stable IDs.

Tasks:
- Define a procedural mesh concept where each mesh has a stable id and name.
- Ensure face/region identifiers are generated by the procedural mesh
  generator (not by array indices) and are stable for AI edits.
- Implement an initial procedural mesh: a ball.
- Add a new "mesh inspector" scene focused on previewing one mesh at a time
  with a reasonable inspection background.
- Enable mouse drag to rotate the mesh in the inspector scene.
- Provide a mesh catalog menu on the right showing the current mesh id and
  name, with controls to cycle/select meshes.
- Add mesh selection/inspection so hovering or clicking a face/region shows
  its stable id, semantic tag, and source info when available.
- Provide a way to copy a short selection summary for AI prompts.
- Add view toggles for wireframe and basic topology overlays (normals or edges)
  to aid inspection.
- Support visual grouping modes such as coloring by semantic tag or generator
  node so parts are easy to reference.
- Keep the new scene and mesh system consistent with existing app/state
  patterns.

## On completion
- When complete mark the AI document as DONE by adding a marker in the first
  line.
- Also rename the AI file to AI_#_title_DONE
- Provide a summary of the changes made in the AI document (very high level,
  one liner)

Summary: Added a mesh inspector state/view/UI plus a procedural mesh catalog (starting with a ball) with stable region ids, hover/click region inspection, and copyable selection summaries.
