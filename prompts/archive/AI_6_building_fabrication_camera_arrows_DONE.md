#Problem [DONE]

The building fabrication scene camera is not movable via arrow keys, making it
hard to navigate and inspect fabricated buildings.

# Request

Add arrow-key camera movement controls to the building fabrication scene.

Tasks:
- Enable camera movement using the arrow keys in the building fabrication
  scene.
- Ensure movement feels consistent with the scene’s camera orientation (e.g.,
  move relative to view/ground plane as appropriate).
- Avoid interfering with existing shortcuts and UI input focus.
- Provide a clear, discoverable hint in the UI or shortcuts panel if one
  exists.

## On completion
- When complete mark the AI document as DONE by adding a marker in the first
  line.
- Also rename the AI file to AI_#_title_DONE
- Provide a summary of the changes made in the AI document (very high level,
  one liner)

Summary: Added arrow-key camera panning in building fabrication and a visible
UI hint for the shortcut.
