# Content 3D (`src/graphics/content3d/`)

Inspector-facing asset definitions and catalogs with stable IDs and metadata.

Put here:
- catalogs/registries, stable IDs, options, metadata
- asset definition modules that compose/parameterize engine3d capabilities

Avoid:
- reusable fabrication helpers that could be shared across multiple assets
