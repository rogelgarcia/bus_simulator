# Project Rules

## Directory Structure

**Graphics Organization:**
- All graphics-related code → `/graphics`
  - 3D assets (models, geometries, generators, Three.js code) → `/graphics/assets3d/`
  - GUI/Visual (CSS, widgets, HUD, UI components) → `/graphics/gui/`

**Principle:** Keep rendering/visual code separate from business logic in `/src`
